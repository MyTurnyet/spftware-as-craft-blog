# Outline: The ADHD Developer's Career Ceiling

**Target Audience**: Both ADHD developers feeling stuck in their careers AND leaders/managers who support them

**Tone**: Empowering and validating, challenging and provocative, honest and vulnerable

**Key Thesis**: Traditional career advancement paths privilege neurotypical traits and narrow definitions of success.
For ADHD developers, the "ceiling" isn't about capability—it's about a mismatch between how we work best and what
advancement typically requires. We need to redefine what "advancement" means and create multiple valid paths to success.

---

## I. Introduction: The Invisible Ceiling

- Open with a moment: The realization that the next step feels impossible, not because you can't do the work, but
  because the work itself doesn't fit
- The pattern many ADHD developers experience: hitting a wall around senior/staff level or when considering management
- This isn't about ability—it's about fit
- **For individuals**: You're not broken or incapable
- **For leaders**: Your advancement criteria may be excluding talented people unnecessarily
- Preview: We need to question what "advancement" really means and create new paths

## II. The Traditional Career Ladder and Why It Doesn't Fit

### A. The Management Track: Executive Function on Hard Mode

- What management typically requires:
    - Juggling multiple people's priorities and schedules
    - Long-term planning and strategic thinking
    - Administrative overhead and process management
    - Navigating organizational politics and relationship management
    - Sustained focus on people problems rather than technical problems

- **The ADHD challenge**: Executive dysfunction
    - Time blindness and deadline management across multiple people
    - Working memory limits when managing multiple contexts
    - Interest-based motivation when the work shifts from coding to coordination
    - Energy management when meetings and interruptions multiply

- **Personal/community stories**: The experience of trying management and realizing it's actively draining

- **For leaders**: Consider whether management should be the only path to higher compensation and recognition
- **For individuals**: It's okay if management isn't your path—that doesn't mean you've failed

### B. The Senior IC Track: The Deep Specialization Problem

- What senior IC roles typically require:
    - Deep, sustained expertise in a narrow domain
    - Long-term focus on complex problems
    - Self-directed work with minimal structure
    - Architectural thinking and future planning
    - Mentoring others (often informally and inconsistently)

- **The ADHD challenge**: Interest-based motivation and sustained focus
    - Difficulty maintaining interest in increasingly narrow specialization
    - The need for novelty and variety versus deep, prolonged focus
    - Hyperfocus on the wrong things or at the wrong times
    - Struggle with self-directed work without external structure

- **Personal/community stories**: The boredom of going deeper and deeper into one thing, the appeal of breadth

- **For leaders**: Question whether specialization is the only model for senior technical contribution
- **For individuals**: Your need for variety isn't a flaw—it's a different cognitive style

### C. The Visibility Problem: Self-Promotion and Politics

- What advancement typically requires:
    - Speaking up in meetings and promoting your work
    - Building a "personal brand" and network
    - Navigating office politics and building alliances
    - Consistent visibility over time
    - Self-advocacy and negotiation

- **The ADHD challenge**: Multiple intersecting difficulties
    - Rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD) making self-promotion terrifying
    - Difficulty reading social cues in political situations
    - Inconsistent performance makes self-advocacy complicated
    - Forgetfulness about documenting and sharing wins
    - Impulsivity saying the wrong thing at the wrong time

- **Personal/community stories**: The toll of trying to be "on" all the time, missing promotions because you didn't ask

- **For leaders**: Recognize that quieter contributors may be doing excellent work you're missing
- **For individuals**: There are ways to build visibility that work with your brain, not against it

## III. The Real Question: What Is Success, Anyway?

### Transition: Maybe the problem isn't us. Maybe the problem is that we've accepted one narrow definition of career success.

- Challenge the default assumption: "Success = climbing the ladder"
- Different questions to ask:
    - What kind of work energizes me?
    - Where do I add the most value?
    - What does success look like *for me*?
    - What kind of life do I want outside work?

- **The radical proposition**: You can stay at mid-level your entire career and that can be a successful, fulfilling
  choice
- Success metrics beyond title and salary:
    - Impact on the product/users
    - Quality of daily work experience
    - Learning and growth (not just upward, but lateral)
    - Work-life balance and sustainability
    - Relationships and collaboration

- **For leaders**: Are you creating space for people to succeed in non-traditional ways?
- **For individuals**: You get to define what success means for you

## IV. Alternative Paths: What Success Can Look Like for ADHD Developers

### Transition: There's something out there for all of us. Here are some alternative models that play to ADHD strengths.

### A. The Perpetual Mid-Level Developer (And Why That's Great)

- Staying at the level where you write code most of the time
- Deep enough to be competent, not so specialized you're bored
- Freedom from management overhead and politics
- **ADHD strengths**: Consistency with what you're good at, avoiding executive function demands
- **What makes this viable**: Companies that decouple compensation from title advancement
- **For leaders**: Create compensation bands that allow people to grow financially without management
- **For individuals**: Give yourself permission to opt out of the ladder

### B. The Context-Switching Generalist

- Making "lack of focus" a feature, not a bug
- Breadth over depth—T-shaped or π-shaped skills
- Moving between projects, technologies, teams
- Full-stack, DevOps, platform roles that require versatility
- **ADHD strengths**: Novelty-seeking, broad interests, ability to connect disparate ideas
- **What makes this viable**: Organizations that value versatility and need people who can bridge contexts
- **For leaders**: Create roles that explicitly reward breadth and adaptability
- **For individuals**: Own your generalist identity as valuable, not less-than

### C. The Mob Programming Specialist / Collaborative Expert

- Building expertise through collaboration rather than solo deep work
- Ensemble/mob programming as a primary working mode
- Knowledge sharing and mentoring as built-in rather than add-on
- **ADHD strengths**: External structure from collaboration, body doubling effects, immediate feedback
- **What makes this viable**: Teams that adopt ensemble programming as their standard practice
- **For leaders**: Recognize that collaborative mastery is still mastery
- **For individuals**: Seek teams and roles where ensemble work is the norm

### D. The Problem-Solver / Firefighter

- Jumping into crisis situations and novel problems
- Short-term, high-intensity work on varied challenges
- Thriving in chaos that others find overwhelming
- Consultant, technical troubleshooter, incident responder roles
- **ADHD strengths**: Hyperfocus under pressure, creative problem-solving, crisis energy
- **What makes this viable**: Organizations that need crisis management and rapid response
- **For leaders**: Value the people who thrive when things are broken
- **For individuals**: Your ability to focus in chaos is genuinely rare and valuable

### E. The Craft Practitioner

- Deep commitment to the craft of software development
- Continuous learning and skill development without narrow specialization
- Mentoring through pairing and mobbing rather than formal programs
- Contributing through quality of work, not title or scope
- **ADHD strengths**: Passion-driven work, mastery without monotony, hands-on creation
- **What makes this viable**: Organizations that respect craftsmanship and technical excellence
- **For leaders**: Create paths where technical excellence is rewarded without management or architecture
- **For individuals**: The craftsperson path is legitimate—you don't need to become an architect

### F. Other Valid Paths

- The serial hobbyist who brings fresh ideas from outside tech
- The technical writer/educator who teaches rather than builds
- The part-time developer who prioritizes other life commitments
- **The key point**: There are many ways to have a successful career in software

## V. Making Alternative Paths Real

### A. For Individuals: Finding and Creating Your Path

- **Self-assessment**: What energizes you vs. drains you?
- **Experimentation**: Try different types of work and teams
- **Communication**: Talk to your manager about what you want (and don't want)
- **Job crafting**: Shape your current role toward your strengths
- **Job hunting**: Look for organizations with diverse career frameworks
- **Community**: Find others on similar paths (mob programming communities, ADHD developer groups)

### B. For Leaders: Creating Space for Alternative Paths

- **Compensation reform**: Decouple pay from traditional advancement
- **Multiple ladders**: Create explicit alternative career tracks
- **Role flexibility**: Allow people to craft roles around strengths
- **Recognize diverse contributions**: Value breadth, collaboration, crisis management, not just depth and leadership
- **Challenge assumptions**: Question whether your senior expectations are necessary or just traditional
- **Support experiments**: Let people try different paths without penalty

### C. Systemic Change We Need

- Industry-wide recognition that one-size-fits-all career paths exclude talent
- More organizations adopting dual-track or multi-track career frameworks
- Compensation transparency and equity across different paths
- De-stigmatizing choosing not to advance into management or architecture

## VI. The Hard Parts (Being Honest)

- This is still hard—alternative paths may mean lower pay or fewer opportunities in some organizations
- Not all companies will support diverse career paths
- You may need to change jobs to find the right fit
- There's grief in letting go of traditional success markers
- RSD and imposter syndrome don't disappear just because you choose an alternative path
- **For individuals**: It's okay to struggle with this; the path is valid even when it's hard
- **For leaders**: Your support and validation matter enormously

## VII. Conclusion: There's Something Out There for All of Us

- The career ceiling for ADHD developers is real—but it's artificial, not innate
- We have the capability; what we often lack is a system that recognizes our strengths
- Success doesn't have to look like the traditional ladder
- **Call to action - For individuals**:
    - Give yourself permission to define success on your terms
    - Seek organizations and teams that value your way of working
    - Find your people—the ones on similar paths

- **Call to action - For leaders**:
    - Have honest conversations with your team members about what success means to them
    - Question your assumptions about what advancement must look like
    - Create space for people to thrive in non-traditional ways

- **For both**: The most important conversation is the honest one—about what each person needs, what energizes them, and
  how we can create space for everyone to succeed

- **Final thought**: Finding your path is important. There's not one right way to be a successful developer. The goal is
  to find the path where you can do great work, grow in ways that matter to you, and build a sustainable career. That
  path might not look like anyone else's—and that's exactly the point.
