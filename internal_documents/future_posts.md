# Future Blog Post Ideas for Software As Craft

## 1. AI Coding Tools: The ADHD Developer's Double-Edged Sword

AI assistants can reduce cognitive load and handle context switching, making them incredibly powerful for neurodivergent
developers. But they also enable impulsive coding without understanding, making it easier to build on shaky
foundations—a particular risk for ADHD developers who already struggle with patience and deep focus.

## 2. Psychological Safety Is Not Comfortable Safety

Most teams confuse psychological safety with never making anyone uncomfortable. Real psychological safety means you can
challenge bad ideas, admit mistakes, and have difficult conversations—all of which feel uncomfortable. The
misunderstanding is making teams fragile, not resilient.

## 3. AI-Generated Code Should Be Treated as Technical Debt

Every line of AI-generated code you don't fully understand is technical debt. Just like copy-pasting from Stack
Overflow, using AI without comprehension creates maintenance nightmares. The faster you can generate code, the more
disciplined you need to be about understanding it.

## 4. The ADHD Developer's Career Ceiling: Why Traditional Paths Punish Your Strengths

Traditional software career progression rewards sustained focus, long-term planning, and political navigation—the exact
things ADHD developers struggle with. Meanwhile, the hyperfocus, pattern recognition, and crisis management skills that
make ADHD developers exceptional are rarely recognized or rewarded in promotion decisions.

## 5. What We Lost When We Went Remote (And Why That's Okay)

Remote work is better for many developers, especially neurodivergent ones. But pretending we didn't lose
anything—spontaneous collaboration, osmotic learning, accidental mentorship—prevents us from building intentional
practices to replace what disappeared. Acknowledge the loss to address it.

## 6. Teaching Your Neurotypical Team About ADHD: It's Not About Accommodation

Framing ADHD needs as "accommodations" reinforces the idea that neurotypical is the default and neurodivergent is
broken. Instead, talk about how diverse cognitive styles improve team outcomes. Your need for written documentation
helps everyone. Your preference for pairing reduces knowledge silos. Stop apologizing for practices that make the whole
team better.

## 7. Your Async-First Culture Is Just Conflict Avoidance

Teams adopt "async-first" communication claiming it's more inclusive and productive. But often it's just an excuse to
avoid difficult real-time conversations. When every hard discussion gets pushed to Slack threads that take three days
and seventeen messages to resolve what would have been a 10-minute video call, you're not being respectful of people's
time—you're being conflict-averse. True async-first means knowing when synchronous is actually faster.

## 8. Burnout Is a Code Smell in Your Organization

When developers burn out, we treat it as an individual problem—resilience training, better work-life balance, self-care.
But burnout is a systemic design problem. It signals organizational technical debt: unrealistic deadlines, poor
architecture, inadequate staffing, toxic culture. Stop trying to fix the developers. Fix the system.
