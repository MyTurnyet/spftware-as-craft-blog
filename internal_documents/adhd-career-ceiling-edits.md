# Editorial Task List: ADHD Career Ceiling Post

## Critical Fixes (Do First)

- [x] **Fix grammar error on line 400**
  - Current: "For both: The most important conversation around about what each person needs..."
  - Change to: "For both: The most important thing is having honest conversations about what each person needs, what energizes them, and how we can create space for everyone to succeed."

## High Priority Additions

- [x] **Add TL;DR at the top** (after line 20, before line 22)
  - Add section header and 2-3 sentence summary
  - Should tell readers what they're getting into for a 4000+ word post
  - Suggested text: "Traditional career paths demand executive function skills that ADHD makes difficult. But the ceiling isn't about capability—it's about finding the right fit. This post explores why traditional advancement doesn't work for many ADHD developers and maps out alternative paths that play to our strengths."

- [x] **Add personal anecdote to opening**
  - Consider opening with brief personal story about hitting your own career ceiling
  - Would make the piece more grounded and build trust

- [x] **Expand personal element in Craft Practitioner section** (line 267)
  - Currently just says "_like me_" in parentheses
  - Expand with 2-3 sentences about your own journey on this path
  - Why did you choose craft over architecture/management?
  - What has that path looked like for you?

## Medium Priority: Tightening & Clarity

- [x] **Tighten "The Visibility Problem" section** (lines 102-140)
  - Currently 38 lines, reduce to 20-25 lines
  - Consider folding "fear of mistakes" paragraph (lines 126-130) into "imposter syndrome" paragraph
  - Keep the powerful insights, reduce repetition

- [x] **Fix perspective jump on lines 169-171**
  - Current: "You get to define what success means for you. Not your parents, not your peer group, not LinkedIn culture. You."
  - Change to: "You get to define what success means for you—not your parents, not your peer group, not LinkedIn culture. Just you."

- [x] **Add transition between sections** (after line 174, before line 175)
  - Smooth the jump from philosophical "Real Question" section to practical "Alternative Paths"
  - Suggested: "So what does that look like in practice? I've seen ADHD developers thrive in all kinds of roles—often ones that don't look like traditional 'career advancement.' Here are some patterns I've observed, any of which could be your path forward."

- [x] **Strengthen the conclusion** (lines 377-407)
  - Currently repeats points made earlier
  - Should synthesize rather than summarize
  - End with clear call to action
  - What's the ONE thing you want readers to do after reading?

## Medium Priority: Structure Improvements

- [ ] **Vary structure in Alternative Paths section** (lines 175-285)
  - All five paths use identical formula (Description → ADHD strengths → What makes viable → For individuals → For leaders)
  - By the third path, feels mechanical
  - Options:
    - Combine some "For individuals/leaders" callouts
    - Add quotes or examples to break up rhythm
    - Use different formatting for 2-3 of the paths

- [ ] **Handle "Other Valid Paths" differently** (lines 287-296)
  - Currently feels like an afterthought compared to the detailed five paths
  - Options:
    - Expand 1-2 of these into full sections
    - Reduce to brief "And many more..." with 2-3 bullets
    - Integrate them as variations on the main five paths

## Lower Priority: Add Concreteness

- [ ] **Add 2-3 more concrete examples throughout**
  - Currently only one quote (lines 89-90)
  - Add specific examples of ADHD developers who thrived in alternative paths
  - Add real scenario of a leader who changed org structure
  - Add anonymous anecdotes from your experience

- [ ] **Make "Making Alternative Paths Real" more actionable** (lines 302-345)
  - Current advice is somewhat generic
  - Add 1-2 concrete scripts or conversation starters
  - Example for "Talk to your manager": "In your next 1:1, try: 'I've been thinking about my career path. I'd like to focus on hands-on technical work and cross-team collaboration rather than pursuing people management. Can we talk about what that could look like here?'"
  - Give specific scenarios for job crafting

- [ ] **Break up long paragraphs**
  - Some paragraphs run 8-10 lines (especially in Alternative Paths section)
  - Look for natural break points
  - Shorter paragraphs are easier to scan on blog format

## Optional: Consider for Tightening

- [ ] **Consider combining three "Traditional Career Ladder" subsections**
  - Currently 98 lines (lines 41-140)
  - Could potentially consolidate into one section
  - But depth is valuable here—only do this if word count becomes a problem

- [ ] **Consider reducing five alternative paths to three deeply explored**
  - Would bring post from 4000 to ~3000 words
  - But topic deserves depth—readers will stick with 4000 words if every paragraph earns its place
  - Only do this if you feel the piece drags

## What's Working Well (Don't Change)

- ✅ Opening hook (lines 22-31) is excellent—immediately relatable
- ✅ Bold reassurances ("You're not broken. You haven't failed.") land powerfully
- ✅ "For individuals / For leaders" structure makes this actionable for both audiences
- ✅ "The Hard Parts" section (lines 358-375) shows intellectual honesty
- ✅ Overall message is both realistic and hopeful
