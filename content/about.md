I'm {{< link "https://www.linkedin.com/in/paige-is-xp/" >}}Paige Watson{{< /link >}}, a Technical Coach who embraces 'Quality Software as Craft' principles. I guide teams in developing well-crafted software solutions designed for maintainability and future growth, while evolving their processes into high-performing, scalable units capable of swiftly delivering top-tier software that meets evolving client needs.

## My Work

I partner with development teams to implement practices that transform how they build software:

**Extreme Programming & TDD** — I guide teams through adopting the {{< link "https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/" >}}12 core XP practices{{< /link >}}, with particular emphasis on {{< link "https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html" >}}test-driven development{{< /link >}} as a design and quality tool.

**Collaborative Development** — I facilitate effective {{< link "https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html" >}}pair{{< /link >}} and {{< link "https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming/" >}}mob programming{{< /link >}} that leverages collective intelligence and accelerates knowledge sharing.

**Neurodivergent-Supportive Environments** — Drawing from my own experience with ADHD, I help teams create workflows
that work with different cognitive styles rather than against them.

**Deliberate Practice Culture** — I establish sustainable learning rhythms through {{< link "https://www.codingdojo.org/" >}}code katas{{< /link >}}, focused practice sessions, and structured skill development.

## Philosophy

Quality software emerges from the right process applied consistently. I believe software development is a dynamic craft requiring discipline, collaboration, and continuous refinement. Quality isn't negotiable—{{< link "https://refactoring.com/" >}}refactoring{{< /link >}} and testing are as essential as writing features. Group decisions consistently outperform individual ones. Test-first development provides crucial structure and clarity.

As {{< link "https://quinngil.com/" >}}Quinn Gil{{< /link >}} articulates, our role is to maintain and increase the value of digital assets over time. Software is never truly "done"—it's continuously refined against evolving quality standards.

## Speaking & Resources

I present talks and workshops on Extreme Programming, Deliberate Practice, Collaborative Programming, and neurodivergent-friendly development. Explore my {{< link myturn-yet-talks >}}talks{{< /link >}} and the {{< link fast-guide >}}FAST Guide{{< /link >}} for practical frameworks and techniques.
