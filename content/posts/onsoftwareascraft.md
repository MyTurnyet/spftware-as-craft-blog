## As A Craft

As a self-proclaimed “Software Crafter”, I view the creation of software as an intricate art form, rather than a routine
task akin to plumbing or factory work. This is not to belittle these professions, which are labor-intensive and require
mastery of complicated processes, but to highlight the unique complexity inherent in software development.

## Quality Code

Unlike tangible products that can be replicated precisely, quality software development is a dynamic process, requiring
the right actions at the right time to produce efficient, bug-free, and extensible code. This process often involves
practices from the Extreme Programming framework, such as Test-Driven Development, Paired-Programming, and close
interaction with stakeholders and users.

As my colleague {{< link "https://quinngil.com/" >}}Quinn Gil{{< /link >}} aptly states in his
post "{{< link "https://quinngil.com/2018/11/11/professional-software-engineer/" >}}As a Software Engineer{{< /link >}}", our role as software
engineers is to maintain and increase the value of the digital assets we’re responsible for. This responsibility necessitates a
continuous pursuit of quality, where refactoring and testing are as crucial as writing '_production_' code. A project is
only '_done_' when it has been thoroughly tested and refined to meet quality standards.
