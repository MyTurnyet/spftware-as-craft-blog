## As A Craft
I self-identify as a  **"Software Crafter"**. I believe that the  **creation of software is a complex endeavor**, more
akin to an artists work, than that of a plumber, electrician or factory worker.

Please be cognizant that I am not putting down anyone who is employed as a plumber, electrician, factory worker, or
whatever. I believe that any (and all) of these jobs can be incredibly thought and labor intensive. But, they are not
complex endeavors. They are complicated endeavors. Learning how to wire an airplane engine, or plumb a house takes many
years of learning and an understanding of many complicated processes. All have products that are tangible and if
reproduced, could (and often) would be almost exact the same product. This is a good thing and what is expected in these
industries.

This is not so with software development, at least, not with quality crafted software.

### Quality Code

Creating quality software is about doing the right thing at the right time to make software that runs correctly,
efficiently, and is bug free. It is extensible, re-usable, easily to refactor, and gives the developer provable feedback
that it works as expected. For me, this practice currently includes many of the processes from
the  [Extreme Programming framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming). Processes like Test-Driven
Development, Paired-Programming, Fast-feedback through automated tests, and close interaction with stakeholders and
users.

As my friend and fellow crafter,  [Quinn Gil](https://quinngil.com/)  puts it in his
post "[As a Software Engineer](https://quinngil.com/2018/11/11/professional-software-engineer/)" :

> I look at my job as a Software Engineer to maintain and increase the value of the digital asset I'm responsible for.

This responsibility must include a view toward continually moving all code (written or not) in a direction of quality.
This means that refactoring and unit/integration/functional tests are just as important as writing 'production' code. A
project or story  **cannot**  be considered 'done' unless it has tests, and time has been taken to ensure that it is in
a quality state.
