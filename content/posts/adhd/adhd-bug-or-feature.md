ADHD is often seen as a challenge—especially in a field like software development, where focus, organization, and deep
thinking are essential. But what if I told you that the same traits that make ADHD difficult can also make us
**exceptional developers** when we learn to work with our brains, not against them?

In this series, I’ll share how ADHD has shaped my journey as a developer, and how practices like  
**Test-Driven Development (TDD), Mob Programming,** and **Discovery Trees** have helped me turn my  
ADHD-related struggles into strengths.

## ADHD: More Than Just “Can’t Focus”

When people hear ADHD, they usually think of **lack of focus**, but that’s only part of the story.

**[Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder)**
is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how a person regulates attention, impulses, and activity levels. It's
not about having no attention, it’s about having inconsistent control over where attention goes.

ADHD is better understood as **inconsistent focus**:

- Sometimes, I struggle to focus at all. (_Where did the last 30 minutes go? Oh, right: YouTube rabbit hole._)
- Other times, I get so deeply focused that I forget to eat, sleep, or drink my coffee while it’s hot.

My brain constantly jumps between ideas, which makes **context switching** a nightmare, but also makes me great at
**connecting seemingly unrelated concepts**.

I can easily forget important details, but somehow remember **obscure code snippets** from years ago.

## How ADHD Shows Up in Software Development

For years, I thought I was just **bad at being a developer**. My brain didn’t seem to work like everyone else’s.  
I’d get overwhelmed by large tasks. Staring at a massive user story felt _impossible_ to start.

I’d struggle with prioritization. Everything felt **equally urgent, or not urgent at all**.  
Context switching drained me. Jumping between bug fixes, feature work, and Slack messages left me mentally exhausted.

I’d **hyper-focus** on the wrong thing. Spending hours tweaking a UI detail, or refactoring a class, while forgetting an
actual deadline or important meeting?

Sound familiar? If so, you’re not alone. But here’s the good news: once I understood why my brain worked this way, I
started finding **software development practices that actually helped**.

## Turning ADHD Into an Advantage

The breakthrough for me was realizing that **some of the best coding practices are also great ADHD coping strategies**.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** gave me structure and prevented endless debugging spirals.

**Collaborative Programming** helped me stay engaged and accountable.

**Discovery Trees** helped me break big tasks into tiny, manageable steps.

In the coming posts, I’ll dive into how each of these practices helped me stop fighting my brain and start working with
it, and how they might help you, too.
