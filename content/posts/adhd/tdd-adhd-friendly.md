If you have ADHD, traditional software development workflows can feel overwhelming. Large tasks, vague requirements, and
long debugging sessions create mental roadblocks that make it hard to start, stay on track, or finish without
distraction. But what if there was a way to break down work into tiny, manageable steps while constantly getting
feedback that keeps you engaged?

That’s exactly what Test-Driven Development (TDD) does. Instead of trying to hold an entire problem in your head at
once, TDD forces you to take one small step at a time—reducing cognitive overload, preventing decision paralysis, and
eliminating debugging distractions.

For me, adopting TDD was one of the biggest game-changers in managing my ADHD while coding. In this post, I’ll explain
why TDD is an ADHD-friendly practice, how it reduces common struggles like overwhelm and working memory issues, and walk
through a simple example to show how it works in action.

## Why ADHD Brains Struggle with Traditional Coding Approaches

ADHD affects the way we approach complex problems. We often experience:

1. Cognitive Overload – Trying to hold too many details in our heads at once leads to mental exhaustion.
2. Decision Paralysis – Not knowing where to start makes it difficult to begin coding.
3. Debugging Distractions – Diving deep into fixing a bug can spiral into endless rabbit holes.

Most traditional coding approaches make these challenges worse. Writing large amounts of code before testing it means
keeping multiple things in working memory: what the code is supposed to do, how it fits into the bigger system, and all
the possible edge cases. When something breaks, debugging is chaotic—leading to frustration, wasted time, and
distraction.

TDD flips this process on its head by **reducing cognitive load**, **providing a clear starting point**, and
**removing the need for debugging** sessions.

## How TDD Works with ADHD Thinking

Test-Driven Development follows a simple cycle:

1. Write a failing test (Red)
2. Make it pass with the simplest possible solution (Green)
3. Refactor the code to improve it (Refactor)

This aligns perfectly with how ADHD brains work:

- Breaking work into tiny steps → Prevents feeling overwhelmed
- Immediate feedback loops → Keeps engagement high
- A structured process → Reduces decision paralysis
- No debugging rabbit holes → Failing tests tell you exactly where the issue is

Instead of trying to solve an entire problem in one go, TDD forces you to focus on just one small step at a time.

## TDD in Action: A Simple Example

Let’s say we need to write a function that adds two numbers together. Instead of jumping in and writing the function
immediately, we follow the TDD cycle.

### Step 1: Write a Failing Test (Red)

Before we write any actual implementation, we first write a test that describes what our function should do:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class CalculatorTest {
   @Test
   public void testAddition() {
      Calculator calc = new Calculator();
      int result = calc.add(2, 3);
      assertEquals(5, result);
   }
}
```
We haven’t written the add method yet, so this test fails. That’s good! It tells us exactly what we need to do next.

### Step 2: Write the Simplest Code to Make the Test Pass (Green)

Now, we implement just enough code to pass the test:

```java
public class Calculator {
   public int add(int a, int b) {
   return a + b;
   }
}
```
When we run the test again, it passes. We’ve written functional code without overthinking, debugging, or getting
distracted.

### Step 3: Refactor if Necessary (Refactor)

The code is already simple, so there’s nothing to refactor here. But if this were a more complex problem, this step
would let us clean up the code while still being confident it works—because our test will immediately catch mistakes.

## How TDD Helps with ADHD Struggles

### 1. Reduces Cognitive Overload

   Instead of juggling multiple requirements in your head, TDD lets you focus on one small thing at a time. When each
   test is written, it acts as a guide, reducing the need to remember what you were working on.

Before TDD: “Wait, what was I trying to do again?”
With TDD: “Oh, my failing test tells me exactly what to do next.”

### 2. Eliminates Decision Paralysis

   ADHD brains struggle with figuring out where to start—especially when the task feels big or ambiguous. TDD removes
   this problem by making the next step obvious: write a test, make it pass, repeat.

Before TDD: “Ugh, this feature is huge. Where do I even begin?”
With TDD: “I’ll start by writing the simplest failing test.”

### 3. Prevents Debugging Distractions

   Debugging is a common ADHD trap. Without a clear process, it’s easy to get sucked into irrelevant details or chase
   tangents that don’t actually solve the problem. TDD prevents this because failing tests immediately pinpoint the
   issue, eliminating guesswork.

Before TDD: “Why is this not working? Let’s print debug logs for the entire app…”
With TDD: “Oh, my test failed because I forgot to handle a null case. Fixing it now.”

### 4. Keeps Engagement High

   ADHD brains thrive on immediate feedback and visible progress. TDD provides a steady stream of small wins—each
   passing test feels like a mini dopamine hit, keeping motivation strong.

Before TDD: “Ugh, I’ve been coding for hours, and I don’t even know if this works yet.”
With TDD: “Yes! My test just passed! On to the next one.”

## Conclusion: TDD as a Tool for ADHD-Friendly Coding

Test-Driven Development isn’t just a best practice for writing high-quality code—it’s a lifeline for ADHD developers. By
breaking work into small, manageable steps, providing clear direction, and eliminating debugging chaos, TDD turns an
overwhelming coding session into a structured, engaging workflow.

If you struggle with focus, task paralysis, or distractions while coding, give TDD a try. It might just be the key to
working with your ADHD brain instead of against it.
