If you‚Äôve ever struggled to stay focused while coding alone but suddenly became ultra-productive when working next to
someone else, you‚Äôve experienced the power of body doubling.

Body doubling is a technique commonly used by people with ADHD to improve focus and accountability. It involves working
alongside another person‚Äînot necessarily to collaborate on the same task, but simply to create an environment where
distractions are minimized and engagement is easier to maintain.

For developers, body doubling naturally exists in two powerful coding practices: Pair Programming and Mob Programming.
These techniques create structured, collaborative work sessions that help ADHD developers stay engaged, avoid
distractions, and manage complex tasks more effectively. In this post, I‚Äôll explore how these practices work, why they
align so well with ADHD brains, and how to make them even more effective.

## Why ADHD Brains Thrive in Collaborative Work

ADHD makes it difficult to self-regulate attention, meaning that tasks requiring sustained effort‚Äîlike debugging a tough
issue‚Äîcan quickly lead to zoning out, procrastinating, or going down an unrelated rabbit hole. However, working in the
presence of others creates a sense of external accountability, making it easier to stay engaged.

Here‚Äôs why collaboration works so well for ADHD brains:

### Social Presence = Externalized Focus

When someone else is working alongside you, it‚Äôs easier to stay present. This is why co-working spaces and study groups
help many people with ADHD get things done.

### Shared Cognitive Load

In a mob or pair programming session, you don‚Äôt have to hold all the context in your head‚Äîyour teammates are there to
help. This reduces cognitive overload and working memory strain.

### Immediate Feedback and Engagement

ADHD brains thrive on instant feedback. Discussing ideas in real-time and seeing progress unfold keeps motivation high.

### Reduced Task Paralysis

When working alone, it‚Äôs easy to get stuck on a decision. In a collaborative session, you have teammates to help push
forward when uncertainty strikes.

## Pair Programming: Focused Collaboration for ADHD Developers

Pair programming involves two developers working on the same task together, typically with one as the driver (writing
code) and the other as the navigator (guiding and reviewing).

### How Pair Programming Helps with ADHD

- Built-in accountability: Harder to get distracted when someone else is working with you.
- Prevents getting stuck: The navigator can help when the driver loses focus.
- Encourages clear thinking: Talking through ideas aloud reinforces focus and decision-making.

### Tips for Effective ADHD-Friendly Pair Programming

- Use the Pomodoro Technique ‚è≥ ‚Üí Take structured breaks every 25‚Äì45 minutes.
- Switch roles frequently üîÑ ‚Üí Keeps both participants engaged.
- Clarify the next step before switching üìù ‚Üí Helps avoid context loss when transitioning.

## Mob Programming: Group Body Doubling on Steroids

Mob programming extends the concept of pair programming to an entire team. The group works together at the same time,
solving problems collaboratively while rotating roles.

### Why Mob Programming is ADHD-Friendly

- Shared focus: Harder to drift off when an entire group is actively coding together.
- More perspectives: Helps ADHD developers who struggle with decision-making.
- Immediate learning: Faster skill-building through real-time discussion.

### Tips for ADHD Developers in Mob Sessions

- Have a facilitator üé§ ‚Üí Keeps the session structured and prevents long tangents.
- Use a strict timer for role rotation ‚è≤Ô∏è ‚Üí Keeps engagement high.
- Make mobbing an inclusive, judgment-free space ü§ù ‚Üí Encourages participation without fear of ‚Äúsaying something dumb.‚Äù

## Collaboration as an ADHD Superpower

For ADHD developers, working alone can be a struggle, but working together can be a game-changer. Mob programming and
pair programming aren‚Äôt just effective development practices‚Äîthey‚Äôre built-in focus tools that naturally align with how
ADHD brains function best.

If you‚Äôve never tried pairing or mobbing before, I highly recommend giving it a shot. In my next post, I‚Äôll dive into
another ADHD-friendly technique: **Discovery Trees‚Äîhow visualizing tasks prevents overwhelm and helps ADHD developers
track progress effectively**.
