Being a developer with ADHD feels like living in two extremes: on one hand, you can hyper-focus for hours on an obscure
bug, completely forgetting the world around you. On the other, you find yourself staring at a simple task, completely
incapable of starting. Add in team meetings, context switching, and a never-ending backlog, and things can quickly
spiral into frustration and burnout.

In this post, I’ll break down some of the most common ways ADHD shows up in the daily life of a software developer—and
how I learned to recognize and manage these struggles.

## Hyper-Focus: The Double-Edged Sword

Hyper-focus is like a superpower… until it isn’t. ADHD brains struggle with regulating attention, which means that
when we do focus, we really focus—often at the cost of everything else.

How This Shows Up at Work:

Spending way too much time on one piece of code, overengineering instead of delivering something simple.
Forgetting to eat, drink, or take breaks while coding. (Cold coffee syndrome, anyone?)
Getting so deep into a problem that you ignore Slack messages, meetings, and deadlines.

How I Manage It:

Setting timers to check in on whether I’m still working on the right thing.
Using pair/mob programming to stay engaged but not get lost in the weeds.
Using Discovery Trees (more on that in a later post) to remind me of the bigger picture and keep track of where I am.

## Task Paralysis and Overwhelm

Ever sat down to work, opened your ticket, and immediately felt like your brain hit a brick wall? That’s task
paralysis—a combination of executive dysfunction, decision fatigue, and analysis paralysis.

How This Shows Up at Work:

Staring at a blank screen because you don’t know where to start.
Feeling overwhelmed by large user stories that have too many moving parts.
Procrastinating on a task because it feels too big, even if it’s actually simple.

How I Manage It:

Breaking tasks into the absolute smallest possible steps. (TDD is amazing for this!)
Using a "five-minute rule": commit to working on it for just five minutes.

Asking a teammate to pair with me to get started. "**Body Doubling**" is a game-changer.

## Memory Issues and Working Memory Overload

ADHD isn’t just about distraction. It also affects working memory, or the ability to hold and manipulate information
in your head. This makes it easy to lose track of what you were doing, or forget key details.

How This Shows Up at Work:

Forgetting why you opened a file in the first place.
Constantly re-reading your own code because you forgot what you just wrote.
Struggling to hold multiple layers of logic in your head while debugging.

How I Manage It:

Writing tests first (TDD) so I don’t have to remember everything while coding.
Keeping a Discovery Tree to track my thought process.
Using checklists for recurring tasks, so I don’t reinvent the wheel every time.

## Rejection Sensitivity and Imposter Syndrome

ADHD often comes with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)—a deep emotional response to perceived criticism or
failure. When combined with imposter syndrome, it can make normal developer challenges feel personally devastating.

How This Shows Up at Work:

Feeling crushed when a PR gets lots of feedback (even when it’s constructive).
Over-explaining or apologizing too much in code reviews.
Avoiding sharing ideas in meetings because you fear they aren’t good enough.

How I Manage It:

Reminding myself that feedback is about the code, not me.
Practicing "done is better than perfect"—perfectionism feeds imposter syndrome.
Surrounding myself with supportive teammates who encourage learning.

## Conclusion: Recognizing ADHD Struggles is the First Step
The challenges ADHD brings to software development are real, but they don’t have to define your career. Once I started
naming these struggles, I could find strategies to work with them—not against them.

In the next post, we’ll dive into one of the biggest game-changers for ADHD developers: **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**,
and why it helps fight overwhelm and cognitive overload.
