### Have you been to an Open Space conference?

I love to go to Open Space conferences and learn so much more from them, as compared to a "tracked" conference. I've been to many good "tracked" conferences and learned at each of them. But often, I find myself skipping sections (sometimes days) when there's nothing that interests me.

How long does it take to organize the agenda for a "tracked" conference? Often Months. You need to get talks proposals. You need to review them, rank them, select them, and then put them into a timed schedule. All this work beforehand to get ready for future work on the assumption that "we know what we want, and what will happen".

In the northwest of the USA, we have  [Open Agile Northwest](https://www.agileopennorthwest.org/), a three-day Open Space conference. Attended by about 150 people, we self-organize the session schedule for the day in about  30 minutes  every morning.

### Why does this work?

#### The Four Principles:

-   Whoever comes is the right people
-   Whatever happens is the only thing that could happen
-   When it starts is the right time
-   When it's over it's over.

#### The Law of Personal Mobility:

If you find yourself in a situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, move to somewhere where you can.

#### Organizing Complexity

Complex endeavors are solved using simple rule sets. When we attend an Open Space conference, we agree to work together with the other attendees to make a great conference.

Self-organization takes place because we all agree on how to work together.

Using  The Four Principles  and  The Law of Personal Mobility, we can organize and have an amazing conference without all the overhead of a "tracked" conference.  We all feel part of the planning and execution of the conference and therefore have more of a shared responsibility in seeing it go well, along with a shared pride when it comes to an end.

Could this work for building software?
--------------------------------------

_(Hint:  The answer is yes!)_

[Fluid Scaling Technology](https://www.fastagile.io/home)  (**FaST**) uses a modified Open Space marketplace to allow the collective to form around the work. The collective selects the work to be done in each value cycle and it is placed in the  FaST  marketplace.  Natural Leadership allows any member of the collective to step forward and steward a chunk of work through the next value cycle, much like a facilitator runs a session at an Open Space conference.  They are not the SME or the team lead, but they are a person who has an interest in seeing the work move forward in the value cycle.

Like in an Open Space conference, joining a team during the **FaST** organizational meeting allows you to work where you would be most effective. Using self-selection to organize the team make-up for the value cycle. If there are no teams that have work requiring your specific skill set, you have the ability (nea  responsibility) to go to another team where you can contribute or learn (see  Law of Personal Mobility).

Collective members choose which team they want to work on, much like you would choose a session at an Open Space conference, activating a sense of responsibility and ownership of the work. This self-selection improves a collective's ability to address work at a more rapid pace, as members learn all areas of the domain and grow the skill sets needed. Each team feels more pride in the work they are doing and the value they are adding to the product.

The knowledge growth that occurs when a member joins a team gets spread around to the entire collective. This creates a "Rising Tide" effect, organically promoting best practices and domain knowledge as teams change. It eliminates knowledge silos and allows all members to work on any team. There is no  [scatter-gather effect](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/scatter-gather/), as the teams practice collaborative programming. Throughput speed increases as there are no silos to gate important work.

**FaST** allows your teams to have the right people at the right time to make sure the best software is created.

### How can I try this?

Sounds amazing, and almost too good to be true.  **FaST** applies a simple ruleset around a complex endeavor to allow people to self-organize around work.

Start by downloading and reading the  [FaST Guide](https://www.fastagile.io/fast-guide). It will give you an outline of the process and practices.

Then message me (here on LinkedIn), or put something on my  [calendar](https://calendly.com/paige-watson), and let's talk about your questions. I've helped implement **FaST** at several companies. It's easy, and the benefits and growth of the teams are immediately visible.

This can work for you too!
