## Team Programming - Conference Workshop

Whole Team Programming, also known as _Mobbing_, or _Ensemble Programming_, is a practice of whole-team collaboration
that
produces higher quality, more rapidly delivered code than solo development.
Participants will learn the basics of communicating as a group, how a team can select and break down work, and why this
practice far outpaces a team of Individual Contributors.
We will collaborate as a group to write code and learn how to work effectively with multiple team members with varying
levels of experience.

Participants will leave with an understanding of how to communicate while collaborating and how to introduce the
concepts to their teams.
You will experience working as a group over several iterations on simple coding tasks to better understand the process
and practice collaboration.

We'll talk about how the different organizational roles (scrum master, PM/PO, etc) are an integral part of the Whole
Team programming process.
Finally, we'll discuss how to transition to a Whole Team approach and the benefits, and pitfalls, that surround it.

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand the benefits of collaborative programming over individual programming.
  -Gain first-hand experience writing code as a group.
- Understanding of the practices of mobbing/ensemble programming.
- Learn how organization roles work on collaborative programming teams
- Understand some of the tools and resources available for collaboration as a "Whole Team".
