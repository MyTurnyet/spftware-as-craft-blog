## Refactoring Legacy Code

Legacy code can be a beast: fragile, complex, and often lacking the necessary tests to ensure changes don’t introduce
defects. But fear not! There are techniques you can use to effectively work with and extend it in a safe and effective
manner.

We will delve into:

- Managing and improving legacy code
- Utilizing Test-Driven Development (TDD) effectively
- Applying the Strangler Fig Pattern to incrementally refactor code without breaking existing functionality

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand the concepts of the Strangler Fig Pattern
- Use Interfaces and Dependency Injection to isolate legacy code to be changed
- Learn the benefits for using the Strangler Fig Pattern as opposed to an application rewrite
