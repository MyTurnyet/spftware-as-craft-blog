If you’ve ever struggled to stay focused while coding alone but suddenly became ultra-productive when working next to
someone else, you’ve experienced the power of body doubling.

**Body doubling** is a technique commonly used by people with ADHD to improve focus and accountability. It involves working
alongside another person, not necessarily to collaborate on the same task, but simply to create an environment where
distractions are minimized and engagement is easier to maintain.

For developers, body doubling naturally exists in two powerful coding practices: **Pair Programming and Mob Programming**.
These techniques create structured, collaborative work sessions that help ADHD developers stay engaged, avoid
distractions, and manage complex tasks more effectively. In this post, I’ll explore how these practices work, why they
align so well with my ADHD brain, and how to make them even more effective.

## Why ADHD Brains Thrive in Collaborative Work

My ADHD makes it difficult to self-regulate attention, meaning that tasks requiring sustained effort (like debugging or 
planning the next task) can quickly lead to zoning out, procrastinating, or going down an unrelated rabbit hole. 
However, working in the presence of others creates a **sense of external accountability**, making it easier to stay
engaged.

Here’s why collaboration works so well for my ADHD brain:

### Social Presence = Externalized Focus

When someone else is working alongside you, it’s easier to stay present. This is why co-working spaces and study groups
help many people with ADHD get things done.  When working alone, it is easy for me to get distracted by email, facebook, 
or any myriad of other things that I find _interesting_. In a group, we're all focused on the task at hand, no one is on
their phone, or checking email, etc.   

### Shared Cognitive Load

In a mob or pair programming session, you don’t have to hold all the context in your head. **Your teammates are there to
help**. This reduces cognitive overload and working memory strain. I don't spiral into feeling overwhelmed with having to
remember huge contexts and concepts.

### Immediate Feedback and Engagement

ADHD brains thrive on **instant feedback**. Discussing ideas in real-time, and seeing progress unfold keeps my motivation
high, and my imposter syndrome low.

### Reduced Task Paralysis

When working alone, it’s easy to get stuck on a decision. In a collaborative session, you have teammates to help push
forward when uncertainty strikes. The team talks about "_next tasks_" and works collaboratively to ensure all the tasks
are understood and completed in the correct order.

## Mob Programming: Body Doubling on Steroids

{{< link "talks/team-programming-at-conferences" >}}**Collaborative Programming**{{< /link >}} extends the concept of 
pair programming to an entire team. The group works together at the same time, solving problems collaboratively while
rotating roles.

### Why Mob Programming is ADHD-Friendly

- **Encourages clear thinking**: In a mob, we talk through ideas aloud, reinforcing group learning and decision-making. 
This is immensely helpful for lowering my imposter syndrome, and my RSD at bay. I don't need to be the most
knowledgeable person.  When my RSD would appear, it is instead replaced by _thoughtful, considerate communication_ 
from the team.

- **Shared focus**: It's harder to drift off when an entire group is actively coding together.  We use 
{{< link pomodoro-technique >}}**Pomodoro timers**{{< /link >}} to take regular breaks, allowing for some other tasks
(like checking emails, taking a walk, or grabbing a snack.)

- **Prevents getting stuck**: The navigator can help me when I lose focus.  In fact, as the driver, all I need to do is 
listen and input what I'm being asked.  As the navigator, when I freeze because I'm unsure of next steps, **_the rest of 
the mob helps out_** as needed to get me back on track and moving forward.

- **Switch roles frequently**: This keeps me engaged as we continually change rolls.  The shift from driver to navigator 
requires me to refocus my thinking, so I never get the distracted/bored feeling of doing the same repetitive task.

- **More perspectives**: I often struggle with decision-making, sometimes to the point of freezing.  In a mob, the
decisions are the responsibility of the whole team.  This allows me to feel less overwhelmed, and feel that my input is
recognized and accepted.

- **Immediate learning**: I build my knowledge through real-time discussion and practice.  Due to my ADHD, reading
documentation, or learning from a presentation is almost non-existent.  The knowledge that I gain in a mob, whether it
is contextual to the product, or better ways of writing code, is reinforced through immediate application and practice.

### Tips for ADHD Developers in Mob Sessions

- **Rotate regularly**: Use a strict timer for role rotation to keep engagement high. I find that less than 10 minutes
is a good time start, although when we do {{< link "adhd/tdd-adhd-friendly" >}}**TDD**{{< /link >}}, we often follow:   
Red → Green → Refactor → _Commit_ → _Rotate_

- **Practice Pomodoro**: Use a {{< link pomodoro-technique >}}**Pomodoro timers**{{< /link >}} to take breaks on a regular cadence. I find 25 minutes working, then a 5-minute
break is a good starting point, but your needs team may vary.  

#### Basic Break Practices
> 1. Stand up, if you can.
> 2. Look outside, or at-least, not at your computer.
> 3. Take a quick walk, or leave the room.
> 4. Don't talk about your work.  This isn't a time to discuss _next steps_, or _architectural decisions_

- **Get a Coach**: {{< link "talks/deliberate-practice" >}}**You don't learn well just by doing.**{{< /link >}}. Having 
someone that can help you and your team become learn to be effective will make work easier and more enjoyable.

- **Talk to your team**: Let them know how they can help you be the most effective as a part of the team.

## Collaboration as an ADHD Superpower

For ADHD developers, working alone can be a struggle, but working together can be a game-changer. Mob programming and
pair programming aren’t just effective development practices: they’re built-in focus tools that naturally align with how
ADHD brains function best.

If you’ve never tried pairing or mobbing before, I highly recommend giving it a shot. In my next post, I’ll dive into
another ADHD-friendly technique: **Discovery Trees: how visualizing tasks prevents overwhelm and helps ADHD developers
track progress effectively**.
