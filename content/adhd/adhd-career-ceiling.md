**TL;DR**  
_Traditional career paths demand executive function skills that ADHD makes difficult. But the ceiling isn't about
capability. It's about finding the right fit. This post explores why traditional advancement doesn't work for many ADHD
developers and maps out alternative paths that play to our strengths: from the perpetual mid-level developer to the
context-switching generalist, collaborative expert, firefighter, and craft practitioner. There's something out there for
all of us._

## Finding the Path

There's a moment many ADHD developers experience, usually somewhere around the senior or staff level: you look at the
next step in your career and realize it doesn't just feel hard, it feels impossible. Not because you can't do the work,
but because the work itself doesn't fit how your brain works.

Maybe it's the management track, with its demand for juggling multiple people's priorities, endless meetings, and
political navigation. Maybe it's the senior developer track, requiring years of deep specialization in an increasingly
narrow domain. Or maybe it's the invisible work of self-promotion and visibility that seems to come naturally to others
but leaves you exhausted and anxious.

You start to wonder: **Is there something wrong with me?** Have I hit my limit?

Here's what I want you to know: whether you're an ADHD developer feeling stuck or a leader supporting a developer with
ADHD: **You're not broken. You haven't failed. The traditional career ladder just wasn't built for the way your brain
works.**

And more importantly: **There's something out there for all of us.** The path forward isn't about fixing yourself to fit
the ladder. It's about finding the path where you can do great work, grow in ways that matter to you, and building a
sustainable career.

## The Traditional Career Ladder and Why It Doesn't Fit

Let's be honest about what the traditional software engineering career path looks like and why it creates a ceiling for
many ADHD developers.

### The Management Track: Executive Function on Hard Mode

When most organizations think about career advancement, they think about management. If you're good at your job, the
next step is managing people who do that job. But here's what management typically requires:

- Juggling multiple people's priorities and schedules simultaneously
- Long-term strategic planning and keeping track of quarterly goals
- Administrative overhead: performance reviews, budget management, organizational processes
- Navigating office politics and managing complex interpersonal relationships
- Shifting focus from solving technical problems to solving people problems

For ADHD developers, this is executive function on hard mode. Time blindness makes managing multiple people's deadlines
treacherous. Working memory limits make context-switching between different people's needs exhausting. Interest-based
motivation means that when the work shifts from the dopamine hit of solving technical problems to the slower burn of
coordination and politics, your brain checks out.

I've heard countless stories from ADHD developers who tried management and found themselves drowning. Not because they
didn't care about their team or weren't smart enough—but because the role demanded the exact cognitive functions that
ADHD makes difficult.

**For individuals**: If management doesn't appeal to you, or you tried it and it didn't work: that's not failure. That's
valuable self-knowledge. It's okay if management isn't your path.

**For leaders**: Ask yourself: Does management really need to be the only path to higher compensation and recognition?
Are you losing talented technologists because they feel pressured to manage in order to advance?

### The Senior Developer Track: The Deep Specialization Problem

Okay, so maybe management isn't your path. What about staying on the technical track?  
The problem is that senior developer roles typically require:

- Deep, sustained expertise in an increasingly narrow domain
- Long-term focus on complex architectural problems that may take months or years to fully realize
- Self-directed work with minimal external structure
- Thinking multiple steps ahead about system evolution and future needs
- Becoming the go-to expert that others consult

For many ADHD developers, this creates a different kind of ceiling. The need for novelty and variety clashes with
increasing specialization. The deeper you go into one area, the harder it becomes to maintain interest. Hyperfocus can
be a double-edged sword. You might spend days obsessing over the wrong problem or struggle to engage with the right one.
And self-directed work without external structure can leave you spinning your wheels.

One developer told me:
> "I love learning new things. The idea of spending the next five years becoming the world's expert
> on a single subsystem sounds like torture."

That's not lack of commitment. It's a different cognitive style that thrives on breadth and variety rather than narrow
depth.

**For individuals**: Your need for variety and novelty isn't a flaw. It's a different way of engaging with software
development, and there are paths that play to this strength.

**For leaders**: Question whether deep specialization is the only model for senior technical contribution. Could your
organization value breadth, versatility, and cross-domain expertise just as much as narrow depth?

### The Visibility Problem: Self-Promotion and Politics

Even if you find a role that fits your cognitive style, there's another barrier: the visibility work required for
advancement.

To move up, you typically need to:

- Speak up confidently in meetings and promote your work
- Build a "personal brand" and professional network
- Navigate office politics and build strategic alliances
- Maintain consistent visibility over time
- Advocate for yourself in performance reviews and negotiations

For ADHD developers, this creates a perfect storm. **Rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD)** makes self-promotion feel
terrifying—what if people think you're arrogant? **Executive dysfunction** means you forget to document wins or miss
opportunities to share them. Difficulty reading social cues makes politics feel like a minefield, and impulsivity means
you might say the wrong thing at the wrong time.

**Imposter syndrome** compounds all of this. When you have brilliant days followed by days where you can barely focus,
it's hard to believe you deserve recognition. Years of actually making mistakes like missing deadlines, forgetting
commitments, saying the wrong thing in meetings, reinforce the belief that it's safer to stay quiet. You downplay your
achievements because you know how much harder everything feels for you. The voice in your head says:
> "If they knew how much I struggle, they'd know I'm a fraud."

So you hold back, even when you have something valuable to contribute.

The result? Excellent work goes unnoticed. Promotions go to people better at visibility work, even if they're not better
at the actual job. A creeping sense that the game is rigged against you.

**For individuals**: There are ways to build visibility that work with your brain, not against it. But it's also okay to
acknowledge that this is genuinely hard and you're not imagining it.

**For leaders**: Your quietest contributors may be doing excellent work you're missing. Are you creating multiple paths
to visibility, not just rewarding those who are naturally good at self-promotion?

## The Real Question: What Is Success, Anyway?

Maybe the problem isn't us. Maybe the problem is that we've accepted one narrow definition of career success: climbing
the ladder.

But what if we asked different questions?

- What kind of work energizes me?
- Where do I add the most value?
- What does success look like *for me*, not for some abstract career trajectory?
- What kind of life do I want outside work, and how does my career support that?

Here's a radical proposition:
> **You can stay at mid-level your entire career, and that can be a successful, fulfilling choice.**

I know that's hard to hear if you've internalized the message that success means constant upward movement. But consider
success metrics beyond title and salary:

- **Impact**: Are you making things better for users or your team?
- **Quality of work**: Do you enjoy your day-to-day work most of the time?
- **Growth**: Are you learning and developing, even if laterally rather than upward?
- **Sustainability**: Can you maintain this pace for years without burning out?
- **Relationships**: Do you have good working relationships and genuine collaborators?

Some of the most successful developers I know (_by these metrics_) have the same title they had five years ago. They're
doing work they love, they're valued by their teams, and they're building sustainable careers. They've given themselves
permission to define success on their own terms.

**For individuals**: You get to define what success means for you. Not your parents, not your peer group, not LinkedIn
culture. You.

**For leaders**: Are you creating space for people to succeed in non-traditional ways? Are you measuring and rewarding
contributions beyond advancement up the ladder?

## Alternative Paths: What Success Can Look Like for ADHD Developers

So what does that look like in practice? I've seen ADHD developers thrive in all kinds of roles, often ones that don't
look like traditional "career advancement." There's something out there for all of us. Here are some patterns I've
observed, any of which could be your path forward. These alternative models play to ADHD strengths rather than fighting
against ADHD challenges.

### The Perpetual Mid-Level Developer (And Why That's Great)

What if you just... stayed at the level where you write code most of the time?

Mid-level developers are deep enough to be highly competent but not so specialized that they're bored. They're hands-on
with the codebase daily. They're not expected to manage people or navigate high-stakes political decisions. They have
more freedom and less overhead.

**ADHD strengths**: You stay in the zone where you're good: writing code, solving technical problems, etc. without
taking on the executive function demands of management or the deep specialization of senior IC roles.

**What makes this viable**: Companies that decouple compensation growth from title advancement. Organizations that
create pay bands allowing developers to continue growing financially at mid-level.

**For individuals**: Give yourself permission to opt out of the ladder. If writing code is what you love, there's no
shame in doing that for your entire career.

**For leaders**: Can a mid-level developer with ten years of experience and excellent technical skills earn what a staff
engineer earns? If not, you're forcing people into roles they're not suited for just to pay their mortgage.

### The Context-Switching Generalist

What if "lack of focus" is a feature, not a bug?

Some ADHD developers thrive on variety. They love learning new technologies, moving between projects, and connecting
disparate ideas. They're T-shaped or π-shaped. They have broad knowledge with a few areas of deeper expertise that shift
over time.

Full-stack roles, DevOps, platform engineering, site reliability: All these fields reward people who can context-switch,
learn quickly, and bridge different domains.

**ADHD strengths**: Novelty-seeking becomes an asset. Your broad interests mean you can see connections others miss. You
can talk to the frontend team, the backend team, and the infrastructure team and translate between them.

**What makes this viable**: Organizations that value versatility and need people who can move fluidly between contexts.
Companies that need bridge-builders and generalists, not just specialists.

**For individuals**: Own your generalist identity as valuable, not less-than. The world needs people who can see the
whole system, not just their corner of it.

**For leaders**: Create roles that explicitly reward breadth and adaptability. Recognize that generalists provide unique
value in connecting silos.

### The Mob Programming Specialist / Collaborative Expert

What if your expertise was built through collaboration rather than solo deep work?

In mob or ensemble programming, the team works together on the same problem simultaneously. Knowledge sharing is
built-in, not an add-on. You're always learning from others while contributing your own perspective. For ADHD
developers, this creates exactly the kind of external structure we thrive on—body doubling effects help with focus,
immediate feedback prevents rabbit holes, and the collaborative environment lets creative connections shine.

When I work with teams that practice ensemble programming, I see ADHD developers light up in ways they never did working
solo. The constant engagement, the shared cognitive load, the way the team keeps you from getting stuck is
transformative.

If you're exploring this path, seek out teams where pair or mob programming is the norm, not an exception. Ask about
collaboration practices in interviews. Connect with the mob programming community. And if you're a leader, recognize
that someone who excels in collaborative work is bringing enormous value even if they're not the solo architect type.
Organizations that adopt ensemble programming as standard practice create space for this path to thrive.

### The Problem-Solver / Firefighter

What if you're the person who thrives in chaos?

Some ADHD developers do their best work under pressure. They love jumping into crisis situations, novel problems, and
situations that others find overwhelming. They're the emergency responders of software development. Hyperfocus under
pressure is real. Crisis energy becomes productive energy. The ability to think creatively when everything's on fire is
genuinely rare and valuable.

I know a consultant with ADHD who describes their ideal day as "five different client problems, all urgent, all
requiring creative solutions." What sounds exhausting to most people is their sweet spot. They can assess complex
situations quickly, context-switch between different client environments, and find solutions under tight deadlines.
They're brilliant at it, and perpetually bored during steady-state maintenance work.

Consulting, incident response, technical troubleshooting, pre-sales engineering: these roles need what you have. If this
sounds like you, stop apologizing for getting bored during quiet periods. Your ability to focus in chaos isn't a weird
quirk, it's a valuable skill that organizations desperately need. Find roles that put you where the action is. And
leaders: recognize and value the people who thrive when things are broken, rather than penalizing them for struggling
with routine operations.

### The Craft Practitioner

What if your path is about mastery of the craft itself?

This is my path. Early in my career, I learned Extreme Programming practices at a job, and something clicked.
Collaborative programming gave me external structure and body doubling. TDD broke overwhelming tasks into tiny,
manageable steps with immediate feedback. Short iterations kept me engaged. "Last Responsible Moment" thinking meant I
didn't have to hold every decision in my head at once.

These practices didn't just make me a better developer, they made it possible for me to *be* a developer. My ADHD brain
finally had practices that worked *with* it instead of against it. And once I experienced that transformation, I
couldn't stop talking about it. I wanted everyone to know that software development could be this way.

I got opportunities to share what I'd learned: speaking at conferences, co-facilitating Developer Learning Hours with
colleagues. I discovered I loved teaching these practices, seeing other developers (ADHD or not) have their own "aha"
moments.

Here's what's interesting: sometimes I wish I had chosen management. With that role, I'd have more agency to help teams
adopt these practices, to shield them from the organizational blowback that happens when they "slow down to go fast" by
investing in learning better techniques. I could create space for teams to work this way without constantly justifying
it.

But I didn't choose management. I chose to move to a Technical Coach role, to spread knowledge on the craft itself.

Because for me, the work is in the doing. Writing tests, pairing with teammates, refactoring toward cleaner code,
mentoring through collaboration rather than oversight. The dopamine hits come from seeing tests pass, from solving
problems together, from continuous learning without narrow specialization.

That's where I thrive, and that's the influence I can have: one team, one collaborative session, one conference talk at
a time.

**ADHD strengths**: Passion-driven work sustains motivation. Continuous learning without narrow specialization keeps
things interesting. Hands-on creation provides regular dopamine hits.

**What makes this viable**: Organizations that respect technical excellence and craftsmanship. Companies influenced by
Extreme Programming, Software Craftsmanship, and similar movements.

**For individuals**: The craftsperson path is **legitimate**. You don't need to become a system architect to be
respected
for excellent technical work.

**For leaders**: Create paths where technical excellence is rewarded without requiring people to become architects or
managers. Recognize that a master craftsperson is providing immense value.

### And Many More

These five patterns are starting points, not an exhaustive list. I've also seen ADHD developers thrive as technical
writers and educators (teaching rather than building), as contractors and freelancers (controlling their own schedule
and variety), and as part-time developers who intentionally prioritize other life commitments. Some are serial
hobbyists who bring fresh ideas from outside tech into their development work.

The key point: there are many ways to have a successful career in software. The traditional ladder is just one option,
and often not the best one for ADHD developers.

## Making Alternative Paths Real

Knowing alternative paths exist is one thing. Actually finding or creating your path is another.

### For Individuals: Finding and Creating Your Path

**Self-assessment**: What energizes you versus what drains you? Keep a journal for a month and note which tasks leave
you energized and which leave you exhausted. The patterns will show you your path.

**Experimentation**: Try different types of work and teams. Can you join a mob programming team for a few months? Can
you take on a cross-functional project? Treat your career as an experiment.

**Communication**: Talk to your manager honestly about what you want and don't want. In your next 1:1, try something
like:

> "I've been thinking about my career path. I'd like to focus on hands-on technical work and cross-team collaboration
> rather than pursuing people management. Can we talk about what that could look like here?"

Or if you're already being nudged toward management:

> "I appreciate that you see management potential in me, but I've realized that's not the direction I want to go. I'm
> most energized by [writing code/solving technical problems/teaching through pairing]. Is there a path here where I can
> grow in compensation and impact without moving into people management?"

This is a valid conversation. This is an important conversation. You're not rejecting growth. You're defining what
growth means for you.

**Job crafting**: Can you shape your current role toward your strengths? Here are some specific ways:

- Volunteer to be the "incident response specialist" if you thrive under pressure
- Propose running a weekly mob programming session if collaboration energizes you
- Offer to be the bridge between frontend and backend teams if you're a generalist
- Start a "Developer Learning Hour" to teach practices you're passionate about
- Ask to focus on one product area if you need sustained focus rather than constant context-switching

The key is identifying what energizes you, then finding a legitimate business need that matches.

**Job hunting**: Look for organizations with diverse career frameworks. In interviews, ask specific questions like:

- "What does career progression look like for someone who wants to stay hands-on technical?"
- "Do you have people who've been at the same level for 5+ years? How are they valued and compensated?"
- "What's your approach to pair or mob programming?"
- "How do you recognize and reward different types of contributions, not just individual heroics?"

Red flags: Companies where everyone at senior+ levels manages people, or where "career development" only means upward
movement.

Green flags: Multiple career ladders documented and visible, people speaking enthusiastically about non-traditional
paths, compensation transparency.

**Community**: Find others on similar paths. Mob programming communities, ADHD developer groups, and online forums can
provide validation, ideas, and support.

### For Leaders: Creating Space for Alternative Paths

**Compensation reform**: Decouple pay from traditional advancement. Create pay bands that allow people to grow
financially without changing roles or taking on management.

**Multiple ladders**: Make alternative career tracks explicit, not just theoretical. Document them. Show examples of
people who have succeeded on different paths.

**Role flexibility**: Allow people to craft their role around their strengths. Not everyone needs to fit the same job
description.

**Recognize diverse contributions**: Value breadth alongside depth. Value collaboration and teaching alongside
individual achievement. Value crisis management alongside steady-state execution.

**Challenge assumptions**: Question whether your senior-level expectations are necessary or just traditional. Does a
staff engineer really need to work independently for months without structure? Or is that just how it's always been
done?

**Support experiments**: Let people try different paths without penalty. If someone wants to step back from management,
support that transition without treating it as failure.

### Systemic Change We Need

This isn't just about individual choices or enlightened managers. We need industry-wide recognition that
one-size-fits-all career paths exclude talent unnecessarily.

We need more organizations adopting dual-track or multi-track career frameworks. We need compensation transparency so
people can see that alternative paths are truly viable. We need to de-stigmatize choosing not to advance into management
or architecture.

The organizations that figure this out first will have a significant competitive advantage: they'll retain talented
people who would otherwise leave.

## The Hard Parts (Being Honest)

I want to be real with you: **This is still hard**.

Alternative paths may mean lower pay in many organizations. Not all companies will support diverse career trajectories.
You may need to change jobs to find the right fit. There's grief in letting go of traditional success markers when
that's what you've been working toward.

And even when you find your path, **all the things we deal with around ADHD don't disappear**. You might still wonder if
you're making excuses or settling for less. You might still compare yourself to others who climbed the traditional
ladder and feel like you failed.

**For individuals**: It's okay to struggle with this. The path is valid even when it's hard. Give yourself grace and
find people who understand.

**For leaders**: Your support and validation matter enormously. When you recognize someone's contributions on an
alternative path, you're helping them see that their choice is legitimate.

## There's Something Out There for All of Us

The career ceiling for ADHD developers is real, but it's artificial, not innate. The problem isn't our capability. It's
a system that only recognizes one way of working and contributing.

Here's what I want you to take away from this: Success doesn't have to look like climbing the ladder. You can build a
fulfilling, sustainable career as a perpetual mid-level developer, a context-switching generalist, a collaborative
expert, a problem-solving firefighter, or a craft practitioner. The path that lets you do great work and grow in ways
that matter to you—that's the right path.

If you're an ADHD developer reading this, start with one conversation. Talk to your manager about what kind of work
energizes you and what drains you. You don't need to have it all figured out. Just start the dialogue. And if your
current organization can't make space for your path, know that there are teams and companies out there that will.

If you're a leader, have that conversation with your team members. Ask them what success looks like for them. Question
your assumptions about what advancement must mean. The talented people on your team who don't fit the traditional mold
aren't problems to fix—they're opportunities to build a more inclusive and effective organization.

The most important step is the next one: Have that honest conversation. Ask the question. Explore the possibility.

There's something out there for all of us. Sometimes finding it just means having the courage to ask for it.
