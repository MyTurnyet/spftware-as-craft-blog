One of the biggest challenges of ADHD is task overwhelm—the feeling of looking at a big project and not knowing where to
start. When faced with an unclear or complex task, ADHD brains often freeze up, leading to procrastination or decision
paralysis.

Enter **Discovery Trees**.

Discovery Trees are a powerful way to **break down tasks visually, make progress visible, and reduce cognitive overload**.
Instead of holding everything in your head, you create a branching tree of steps that shows exactly what needs to happen
next. This makes it easier to stay on track, track dependencies, and avoid getting stuck.

In this post, I’ll explain how Discovery Trees work, why they’re ADHD-friendly, and how you can use them in software
development.

## Why ADHD Brains Struggle with Task Management

ADHD affects executive function, which makes it difficult to:

- Break down large tasks into manageable steps.
- Prioritize effectively when faced with many options.
- Remember what needs to be done next without external reminders.

Traditional to-do lists don’t always work because they are linear and overwhelming. Discovery Trees solve this by
providing a visual, non-linear way to track work, making it easier to see the relationships between tasks.

## How Discovery Trees Work
A Discovery Tree is a mind-map-like diagram that visually represents tasks and their dependencies.

### Example: Using a Discovery Tree for a Coding Task
Let’s say we’re adding a new login feature to an app. Instead of a flat to-do list, we create a Discovery Tree:

```pgsql

[Login Feature]  
├── [UI Design]  
│   ├── Create login form  
│   ├── Add error messages  
│   ├── Style input fields  
│  
├── [Backend API]  
│   ├── Set up authentication endpoint  
│   ├── Encrypt passwords  
│   ├── Write user database schema  
│  
├── [Testing]  
├── Write unit tests  
├── Test invalid credentials  
├── Check session persistence
```  

This visual approach makes it easy to see which steps are independent (can be worked on in parallel) and which tasks
depend on others (must be done in order).

## How Discovery Trees Help ADHD Brains

1. Reduces Cognitive Overload
   Instead of trying to remember everything, the tree externalizes memory—you can see what needs to be done at a glance.

2. Provides a Clear Next Step
   Whenever you finish a task, you don’t have to think, “What should I do next?”—the tree shows you what’s next.

3. Breaks Large Problems into Small, Achievable Steps
   Seeing a big task as a series of tiny branches makes it feel manageable, reducing overwhelm.

## How to Create Your Own Discovery Tree

- Use whiteboards, sticky notes, or tools like Miro (insert link to template here)
- Start with the main goal at the top and break it into smaller sub-tasks
- Rearrange as needed—Discovery Trees are flexible!

## Thinking Visually to Work Smarter
For ADHD developers, traditional task management tools can be frustrating—but Discovery Trees offer a dynamic, visual
way to plan work and track progress.

If you’ve ever felt stuck or overwhelmed by a project, try drawing it out as a Discovery Tree. You might be surprised at
how much easier it is to start, focus, and finish your work.
