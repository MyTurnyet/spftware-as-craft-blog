## ADHD and the Developer’s Journey

When I was first diagnosed with ADHD, I thought it was a flaw—something that made me worse at my job. I struggled with
focus, working memory, and context switching. I constantly felt like I was playing catch-up, trying to **force myself 
into traditional productivity methods** that didn’t work for my brain.

But over time, I realized something important: {{< link "./adhd-bug-or-feature" >}}**ADHD isn’t a flaw. it’s just a different operating system.**{{< /link >}} Instead of
trying to fight against it, I started **experimenting with different coding techniques, workflows, and team practices** 
that actually played to my strengths.

In this series, I’ve shared those techniques—what worked, what didn’t, and how I transformed the way I develop software.
Now, I want to wrap it up by bringing everything together and reinforcing the key idea:

> ADHD isn’t something to fix. It’s something to work with.

And when you use the right tools, it can actually become your greatest strength.

## The Techniques That Transformed My Work

Through trial and error, I’ve found a **set of practices** that help me stay focused, manage my cognitive load, and get
deep, meaningful work done. If you’re an ADHD developer (or if you work with one), these might be game-changers for you,
too.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD): My Built-in Focus System

One of the biggest ADHD struggles is **cognitive overload**: holding too many things in my head at once. Before I started
using TDD, I would often get lost in my own code, debugging for hours without making meaningful progress.

{{< link "./tdd-adhd-friendly" >}}TDD **changed everything**{{< /link >}} for me.

*  It forces me to **break work into the smallest possible steps**, keeping me from feeling overwhelmed.
*  Instead of holding an entire problem in my head, I let the tests **guide my thinking** step by step.
*  I don’t have to waste time debugging mysterious issues because **I never write untested code**.
*  It eliminates **decision paralysis**. The test tells me exactly what to do next.

TDD isn’t just a coding technique; it’s a **_mental scaffolding system_** that keeps my ADHD brain on track.

### Collaborative Programming: Body Doubling for Developers

ADHD brains thrive on external structure and accountability, which is why I fell in love with 
{{< link "./collaborative-programming-body-doubling" >}}**Collaborative Programming**{{< /link >}} practices. These 
practices mimic **body doubling**, a well-known ADHD strategy where working alongside someone else makes it easier to 
focus.

When I’m mobbing or pairing:

* **I stay engaged** because there’s a constant social component.
* I don’t get stuck in **_rabbit holes_** because my teammates keep me moving forward.
* It **reduces decision fatigue** because we collaborate on solutions instead of overthinking alone.
* I actually **enjoy the process** instead of getting lost in procrastination or perfectionism.

For ADHD developers who struggle with isolation, distraction, or task initiation, mob and pair programming can be
game-changers.

### Discovery Trees: The Key to Avoid Being Overwhelmed

One of the worst feelings for an ADHD developer? **Looking at a massive, undefined task and not knowing where to start.**

That’s why I use {{< link "./discovery-trees-visualizing-tasks" >}}**Discovery Trees**{{< /link >}}, a simple but 
powerful visual technique for breaking tasks down into manageable steps.

* Instead of an overwhelming blob of work, I create a **visual map of tasks**.
* I focus on the **smallest next step** instead of trying to plan everything at once.
* It helps with **working memory issues**. I don’t have to remember where I left off.
* It prevents me from feeling _stuck or scattered_ because I always have **a clear path forward**.

If you struggle with **starting tasks, remembering details, or figuring out next steps**, Discovery Trees can help take that
burden off your brain.

### Building an ADHD-Friendly Team Culture

ADHD (and neurodiversity in general) isn’t just a personal challenge—it’s something **teams need to be aware of**. 
Too many engineering cultures operate under the assumption that everyone thinks the same way, but that’s just not true.

To create **ADHD-friendly workplaces**, teams can:

* **Embrace flexibility** – Let people work in ways that support their brains.  This can include collaborative 
    programming, _Last-Responsible Moment_ design, and using 
    {{< link "pomodoro-technique" >}}**Pomodoro timers**{{< /link >}}, etc. 
* **Improve communication clarity** – Written documentation, clear expectations, and avoiding unnecessary meetings.
* **Leverage neurodivergent strengths** – ADHD developers bring creative problem-solving, pattern recognition, and
hyperfocus.

When teams support different ways of thinking, everyone benefits—not just neurodivergent people.

## ADHD Isn’t a Weakness: It’s a Different Way of Thinking

If you take one thing away from this series, I hope it’s this:

**ADHD isn’t a flaw, it’s a different way of operating.**

Yes, it comes with challenges, but when given the **right tools, techniques, and team support**, ADHD developers can 
excel in ways others can’t. We just need to work _with our brains_, not against them.

For me, TDD, Collaborative Programming, Discovery Trees, and other work techniques **transformed my productivity and 
happiness as a developer**. If you struggle with focus, overwhelm, or scattered thinking, I encourage you to 
**experiment with these techniques** and find what works for you.
