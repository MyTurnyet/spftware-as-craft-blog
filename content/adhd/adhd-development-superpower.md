## ADHD and the Developerâ€™s Journey

When I was first diagnosed with ADHD, I thought it was a flawâ€”something that made me worse at my job. I struggled with
focus, working memory, and context switching. I constantly felt like I was playing catch-up, trying to force myself into
traditional productivity methods that didnâ€™t work for my brain.

But over time, I realized something important: ADHD isnâ€™t a flawâ€”itâ€™s just a different operating system. Instead of
trying to fight against it, I started experimenting with different coding techniques, workflows, and team practices that
actually played to my strengths.

In this series, Iâ€™ve shared those techniquesâ€”what worked, what didnâ€™t, and how I transformed the way I develop software.
Now, I want to wrap it up by bringing everything together and reinforcing the key idea:

> ADHD isnâ€™t something to fix. Itâ€™s something to work with.

And when you use the right tools, it can actually become your greatest strength.

## The Techniques That Transformed My Work

Through trial and error, Iâ€™ve found a set of practices that help me stay focused, manage my cognitive load, and get
deep, meaningful work done. If youâ€™re an ADHD developer (or if you work with one), these might be game-changers for you,
too.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD): My Built-in Focus System
One of the biggest ADHD struggles is cognitive overloadâ€”holding too many things in my head at once. Before I started
using TDD, I would often get lost in my own code, debugging for hours without making meaningful progress.

TDD changed everything for me.

âœ… It forces me to break work into the smallest possible steps, keeping me from feeling overwhelmed.
âœ… Instead of holding an entire problem in my head, I let the tests guide my thinking step by step.
âœ… I donâ€™t have to waste time debugging mysterious issues because I never write untested code.
âœ… It eliminates decision paralysisâ€”the test tells me exactly what to do next.

TDD isnâ€™t just a coding technique; itâ€™s a mental scaffolding system that keeps my ADHD brain on track.

### Collaborative Programming: Body Doubling for Developers

ADHD brains thrive on external structure and accountabilityâ€”which is why I fell in love with mob programming and pair
programming. These practices mimic body doubling, a well-known ADHD strategy where working alongside someone else makes
it easier to focus.

When Iâ€™m mobbing or pairing:

âœ… I stay engaged because thereâ€™s a constant social component.
âœ… I donâ€™t get stuck in rabbit holes because my teammates keep me moving forward.
âœ… It reduces decision fatigue because we collaborate on solutions instead of overthinking alone.
âœ… I actually enjoy the process instead of getting lost in procrastination or perfectionism.

For ADHD developers who struggle with isolation, distraction, or task initiation, mob and pair programming can be
game-changers.

### Discovery Trees: The Key to Avoiding Overwhelm

One of the worst feelings for an ADHD developer? Looking at a massive, undefined task and not knowing where to start.

Thatâ€™s why I use Discovery Treesâ€”a simple but powerful visual technique for breaking tasks down into manageable steps.

âœ… Instead of an overwhelming blob of work, I create a visual map of tasks.
âœ… I focus on the smallest next step instead of trying to plan everything at once.
âœ… It helps with working memory issuesâ€”I donâ€™t have to remember where I left off.
âœ… It prevents me from feeling stuck or scattered because I always have a clear path forward.

If you struggle with starting tasks, remembering details, or figuring out next steps, Discovery Trees can help take that
burden off your brain.

### Managing Cognitive Load: Fighting Context Switching and Burnout

ADHD brains do not handle context switching well. Every time I jump between tickets, Slack messages, and code, my brain
has to reset, and I lose valuable focus time.

So I use techniques to protect my deep work time:

âœ… Timeboxing & Focus Blocks: I schedule uninterrupted coding sessions and shut off notifications.
âœ… Task Batching: Instead of bouncing between unrelated tasks, I group similar work together.
âœ… Deep Work Strategies: I use noise-canceling headphones, Pomodoro sprints, and dedicated "no Slack" time to stay in the
zone.

If your work feels scattered and chaotic, reducing context switching can massively improve your focus and energy levels.

### Building an ADHD-Friendly Team Culture

ADHD (and neurodiversity in general) isnâ€™t just a personal challengeâ€”itâ€™s something teams need to be aware of. Too many
engineering cultures operate under the assumption that everyone thinks the same way, but thatâ€™s just not true.

To create ADHD-friendly workplaces, teams can:

âœ… Embrace flexibility â€“ Let people work in ways that support their brains (async work, flexible hours).
âœ… Improve communication clarity â€“ Written documentation, clear expectations, and avoiding unnecessary meetings.
âœ… Leverage neurodivergent strengths â€“ ADHD developers bring creative problem-solving, pattern recognition, and
hyperfocus.

When teams support different ways of thinking, everyone benefitsâ€”not just neurodivergent people.

## ADHD Isnâ€™t a Weaknessâ€”Itâ€™s a Different Way of Thinking

If you take one thing away from this series, I hope itâ€™s this:

ADHD isnâ€™t a flawâ€”itâ€™s a different way of operating.

Yes, it comes with challenges, but when given the right tools, techniques, and team support, ADHD developers can excel
in ways others canâ€™t. We just need to work with our brains, not against them.

For me, TDD, Mob Programming, Discovery Trees, and deep work techniques transformed my productivity and happiness as a
developer. If you struggle with focus, overwhelm, or scattered thinking, I encourage you to experiment with these
techniques and find what works for you.
